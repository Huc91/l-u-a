			Cellular automata are mathematical idealisations of natural systems which promise to provide mathematical models for a wide variety of complex phenomena.
			They are a collection of “coloured” cells on a grid of specified shape that evolves through a number of discrete time steps according to a set of rules based on the states of the neighbouring cells. The rules are then applied iteratively for as many steps as desired.
		</br>
		<h2>
			THE BEAUTY IS IN THE PROCESS!
		</h2>
		</br>
		</p>
		Starting from Wolfram’s concept of Cellular Automaton, we created a proprietary algorithm based on 4 parameters + a ruleset to determine algorithmically infinite logos.
		The parameters define the first row of the matrix, and the logo will be constructed algorithmically in a random form based on the parameters and the set of rules. Each logo created will be unique and unrepeatable.
		The beauty is in the process, because the process to reach the suitable algorithm was a trial and error iterative process, which took us weeks to code. During this period we tried to “control” the randomness of the algorithm in a continuous discorso between art and order, human aesthetics and machine execution.
		The concept behind the logo originates from the philosophy at the base of “Umanesimo Artificiale” which is represented by the question: “What does it mean to be human in the age of artificial intelligence?"

		<h3>
			The Parameters
		</h3>
		<p>
			<h4 class="param"><span>Creativity:</span> Renaissance paintings</h4>
			What better way to represents human genius and talent than Renaissance paintings? And why not make a machine learning algorithm choose for you, in a process of co-creation between the artist and the technology?
			We turned then to Google Arts and Culture to let its algorithm select images based on criteria we defined: must be paintings from the Renaissance with prevalent color yellow  because yellow is the color of creativity and emotions
		</p>
		<p>
			<h4 class="param"><span>Ambition:</span> Space photos by NASA </h4>
			“We choose to go to the Moon”</br>
			(John F. Kennedy speech about the effort to go to the moon, 1962).</br>
			It is well known among the experts, that one of the biggest differences between human and machines - and what made possible for humans to become the most evolved species - is the ambition to always take the next step, to explore.
			In order to survive, we don’t have to go to the moon, we don’t have to go to Mars, but we want to. Computers don’t have career ambitions; they don’t want to travel to Asia to see how people live over there. We, humans, do! And that’s something that no one can take from us.
			What’s better than space photos from NASA to represent this value?
		</p>
		<p>
			<h4 class="param"><span>Efficiency:</span> Binary Code</h4>
			We wanted to represent how any computer “speak”: through binary code 0 and 1.
			The higher the parameter, the higher 0 and 1 will be interpreted by the algorithm and transformed in 0 and 1 from black and whit cells.
		</p>
		<p>
			<h4 class="param"><span>Immortality:</span> Geometric forms</h4>
			What represents no life? An empty cell and what represents perfection, immortality, divine figures? A circle.
			Mutations starts from an empty rectangular cell and grows the higher the parameter, until it becomes a circle.
